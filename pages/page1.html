Once when the computers were very big and having one computer is very huge in those days, communicating with each other was very difficult doing login and updating every computer was taking a lot of time. Then Licklider came up with a brilliant idea of Intergalactic Computer Network, which was like having a remote computer login where it is connected to all other computers after helped ARPA in their space program by computer communications, later it was named as ARPAnet which later was succeeded by INTERNET later Leonard Klienrock a Professor from MIT came up with a brilliant idea of queuing theory and communication which was simply Demand Access and Distributed access for better communication, which was used to control regulate and reroute traffic at that time. As there were serious concerns about telecommunications as the only way of communication for the military, there comes Paul Baren who introduced Fish Network called Hot Potato Routing, by cutting up data into bits and bits and sending them though few nodes, just like mice in a maze.</p>

                            Later, the ARPAnet and INTERNET was released open to the public, eventually ARPAnet was shut down and INTERNET was on the throne.</p>
